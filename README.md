## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of deepfake technology and fake news poses significant threats to society. Deepfakes, which are highly realistic manipulated media, have the potential to deceive individuals and manipulate public opinion. Similarly, the spread of fake news undermines trust in information sources and leads to widespread misinformation. Recognizing the urgent need to address these challenges, our team has developed the Bloodline project, which offers a suite of tools designed to safeguard individuals from the perils of manipulated media and false information.

*Key Features*

- **Guardian (Deepfake Detection):**  Advanced AI model that analyzes images to expose deepfakes, protecting users from manipulated media.
- **TruthGuard (Fake News Detection):** Combats the spread of misinformation by pinpointing fake news articles, promoting truth and transparency.

## **Functioning of model**
### 1. Guardian: Detection of DeepFake Images
We have implemented deepfake image classification using Progan dataset. It involves reading and preprocessing images from a ProGAN dataset, extracting features using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model, visualizing feature embeddings, and implementing image classification using nearest neighbor and linear classification approaches.

#### Data Reading
- Reading data from **ProGan** (Real and Fake Images) for **Training Phase**
- It iterate over each file and **Reads** the image using cv2.imread()
- It checks if the image is in **RGB Format** and appends the image if it satisfies this criterion
- Now we **Resize** the image into **(224,224,3)** dimensions

#### Preprocessing
- 1. **JPEG Compression** : It converts the format of image to .jpg with 80% 
- 2. **Gaussian Blur** :  It applies a gaussian blur filter with kernel size=(5,5) and std dev=0 to half of the images using np.random.rand()<0.5

 #### Feature Extraction

Features from the images are extracted using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model. The features are then saved for further analysis and classification tasks.

#### Linear Classification Approach

For **Linear Classification**, I am training a neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API **(FCNN network)**

1. **Data Preparation**: `features_real` and `features_fake` are concatenated into `X_train`and corresponding labels `Y_train` are defined. Then both are converted into numpy arrays

2. **Hyperparameters**: 
    - **Batch Size:** 30 (as instructed in the research paper)
    - **Epochs:** 7 (The model acheives a training accuracy of 1 so trained on less no of epochs)

3. **Model Structure**: It consists of two fully connected layers: 
    - First layer has 768 units and uses the ReLU activation function.
    - Output layer has 1 unit with a sigmoid activation function, for binary classification problems.

4. **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function. 
    - Used **Adam** as optimizer
    - Used **Binary crossentropy loss** as Loss Function
  
#### Accuracy
- I had trained on Progan image set

| Dataset              |    Accuracy   |     SOTA      |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| CycleGan             |    97.3%      |     98.5%     |
| Dalle and Laion      |    92.9%      |     86.78%    |
| Glide-100 and Laion  |    86.9%      |     79%       |

#### Resullts

#### Data Reading and preprocessing
- Merged data from multiple sources containing factual and news articles, both real and fake, to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Modified input text by converting it to lowercase, removing digits, new lines, HTTP links, HTML tags, and special characters to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

##### Data Loading
- Utilizes the TextDataLoaders class from the Fastai library to load the prepared dataset.
- Reads data from CSV files, including news articles labeled as real or fake.

##### Model Architecture
- Implements a text classifier using the AWD_LSTM architecture.
- Utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for text classification.

#### Training of Model
1.  Creating a DataLoader object `dls` containg training and validation data
      - Validation split- 20%

2. Initializes a text classifier model (`learn`) using the AWD-LSTM architecture 

      Specifies the DataLoader (`dls`) and evaluation metric (accuracy).

3. Trraining the text classifier model (`learn`) using the one-cycle policy

   - Learning Rate=0.01

4. Creating an interpretation object (`interp`) from the trained model (`learn`) for classification tasks

5. Generating a confusion matrix plot using the interpretation object (`interp`), showing the performance of the model on different classes.

#### Accuracy:
The model trained using LSTM obtained 93% accuracy
Below is the confusion matrix on training data
